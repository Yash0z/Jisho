### About Configuration

Well, everything is parsed from a single configuration file located in the root directory. You can fully customize it to suit your preferences.

To add your own collection:

      1. Create a folder inside the /app/  directory with 
         a name of your choice.
      2. Then, Link that folder in the configuration file.

And that’s it — you’re good to go.
### Thank You
