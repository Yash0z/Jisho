### About Configuration

Well, everything is parsed from a single configuration file located in the root directory. You can fully customize it to suit your preferences.

To add your own collection:

Create a folder inside the /app/ directory with a name of your choice.

Then, Link that folder in the configuration file.

And that’s it — you’re good to go.
### Thank You
